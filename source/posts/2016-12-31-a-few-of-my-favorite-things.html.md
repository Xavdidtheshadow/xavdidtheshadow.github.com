As 2016 draws to a close, it's a convenient time to look back on the last 12 months to some of the media I've enjoyed the most this past year. It might have been a tire fire as far as politics and celebrity deaths go, but there are a lot of metrics [trending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei8M9IuqPc) in the right [direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThmAZ9yXqE). One of those is apparently digital media, because it's been a pretty great year.

I started getting into tracking what I read and watch in earnest this year, so in an effort to bear the fruits of that labor, I thought I'd make a year-end list of my own. This endeavor in inspired in no small party by [Viticci's list](https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-web-services-2016-edition/) of a similar theme.

It's also worth noting that these things may not have been released in 2016, but this calendar year is the first time I experienced/finished them. Enough chatting though. Let's get to it!

## Board Games

There's never been a better time to have a board game habit. [^1] Sitting around a table with friends is totally back in [vogue](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/behind-hollywoods-closed-doors-a-912169). This increased demand has lead to an [golden age](http://www.military.com/off-duty/games/2016/09/06/physical-board-games-are-experiencing-golden-age.html) of game production. Kickstarter's continued popularity has helped. Across the site's history, games are still the [most backed](https://www.kickstarter.com/help/stats) category.

As great as boardgames can be, they're not without drawbacks. For games that are best with 4+ people, it can be tough to get a big group to the table. Some games require constant shuffling or managing a lot of small cubes. Digital boardgames go a long way towards fixing some of these gripes by having sophisticated AI systems and counting all of the pieces for you. They're not a replacement for physical games in person with friends, but they're a great alternative when that's not possible.

This became especially relevant after I left my job in May. It became a lot less convenient to attend the office's weekly boardgame night. Plus once my travel picked up in earnest, it was even less feasible. Remote teams are great, but they don't lend themselves well to in-person gaming sessions. Going forward, we're going to try to re-establish our weekly meetup. This'll let us play more games and hopefully have a consistent gang to finally finish Pandemic Legacy.

### Physical

Winner: **Machi Koro**

I think what cements Machi Koro as one of my favorite games from this year is that as soon as I finish playing it with a group for the first time, everyone immediately wants a second go. There's not always that level of enthusiasm with new games but the pleasant design and wealth of choices make this a great game to jump into. This is a lighter game that mechanically finds itself between Settlers of Catan and Dominion. You get resources based on everyone's dice rolls, but you have a bit more agency with your luck as you can choose which rolls benefit you based on which cards you buy. There's an expansion that changes which cards are available in the middle (it makes the piles random instead of static) if you find the game isn't varied enough. It also adds some nautical features which can help pad game length. There's a lot of simple tweaks to adjust the game to your group's preference and playstyle, and the game feels fun no matter which you choose. Again, it's light, but undeniably fun.

Runner-up: **Tokaido**

For a game about travelers on a leisurely journey up the Japan's [Eastern Sea Road](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%C5%8Dkaid%C5%8D_(road)), there's a delightful amount of spite that manifests itself. Player interaction is frequent, but somewhat indirect (it happens only through taking board locations you know they want). There's a lot of flexibility when it comes to strategy and the character cards add a lot of replayability. The art is gorgeous and there's a good icon system that permeates everything, so it's fairly easy to tell which cards relate to which spaces. Games are fast but active- turns pass quickly. If digital is your thing, you'll be pleased to know there's an app [on the way](http://www.dageeks.com/games/tokaido-is-getting-an-app-for-the-android-and-ios-and-it-looks-awesome/)!

### Digital
Twilight Struggle, Sentinels?

## Videogames

This has been a weird year for me as far as videogames are concerned. When picking games I tend to prioritize story above most other factors; neither of my picks have much of a story. I've been making a concerted effort to not buy any new games (despite sales) and to instead work on my backlog; both of my picks this year were newly purchased for full price. [^2] Nevertheless, I played some pretty astounding stuff this year and I'm excited to share them with you.

### PC/Console

Winner: **Factorio**

I've always had a thing for [automation](/blog/2014/12/16/augmenting-automation-on-ios/) and when I saw there was a mining game that held it as a core focus, I couldn't stay away. I bought *Factorio* for my birthday and proceeded to play 35 hours in a week (placing it squarely in one of my [most-played](https://steamcommunity.com/id/xavdidtheshadow/games/?tab=all) steam games of all time). After destroying my sleep schedule and finally launching the rocket, I had only scratched the surface of the game. [^3]

![](https://i.imgur.com/6WvZjm5.jpg)

In *Factorio*, you play the role of a space traveler stranded on a hostile planet. Your ultimate goal is to build a rocket and escape. You start from scratch-  To do so, you build a factory that What impressed me most about this game was the polish and number of ways the player has to automate actions. There's a number of chests that can offer or request supplies, a full [turing complete](https://www.reddit.com/r/factorio/comments/43giwy/i_made_a_programmable_turingcomplete_computer_in/) system of wires and number-counters, and a programmable train system. Together, these mean the player has an amazing amount of control when it comes to how their factory runs.

Much like programming, there are many paths to success, but they're not created equal. The road to perfection is paved by "just 5 more minutes, I want to fix this one thing". There's an addictive quality to perfection and this game is the dealer. It taunts you with small improvements that will prevent bottlenecks and improve supply distribution and asks only your entire day in return.

Multiplayer mode and headless servers mean that you can collaborate with friends (synchronously or otherwise). Add that with the joy of designing an well-thought-out base and extensive mod support and you've got a masterpiece that you can play basically forever.

The developers have taken a unique [no sale](https://www.factorio.com/FAQ) stance on their pricing. Though I was initially annoyed, their continued support and clear love of the game and its community reassure me that this game is indeed worth the Jackson ($20, or local equivalent) it'll run you.

Runner-up: **The Witness**

At it's surface, *the Witness* is a game about increasingly complex line puzzles. There's no combat, no story to speak of, and no music. You walk around and draw lines through grids to satisfy unexplained constraints. What makes the game so great?

![](https://i.imgur.com/r61H5qm.jpg)

Let's start with the most obvious: the game is drop-dead gorgeous. Color is used well and the island feels equal parts alive and abandoned. The developers clearly took great care in the design of every aspect of the island. Everything from the foliage to the architecture serves a purpose, usually to build and inform the theme of nearby puzzles. Atmosphere plays a large role in puzzle design and vice versa. There's a wonderful moment about 30 minutes into the game as you're solving a series of paired panels. Drawing one is mirrored on the both and solutions must satisfy both panels simultaneously. As you walk down a path from the first section towards the second, you're flanked by strangely shaped pairs of vases. On first pass they're fairly unremarkable, but nothing in the game is placed on accident. On the way out, you may notice that the vases are inverses of each other, strengthening the theme of the mirrored panels.

In addition to its meticulous environment design, the pedagogy of the puzzles shines. There's no dialog or formal tutorial, but the game teaches you the rules to 7(ish) symbols and how they affect a solution. A reddit user summarizes it better than I can:

> Probably the best thing I've played in around three years. The Witness is the only game I've ever played that bottled that sense of discovery, that made me feel it over and over again. More than anything, it's a game about language. ... [I]nstead of finding items that let you solve puzzles, you find knowledge that does the same. He took the inventory away from a screen in the game and put it in the player's head, and he does it all without using any English. He creates a new language and teaches it to you.

*The Witness* is unique in the [metroidvania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metroidvania) genre. There's no enforced order to solving the puzzles in the 10(ish) areas of the island. Your travel is limited only by the sorts of puzzles you're able to solve. This results in very rewarding exploratory opportunities as the results of your gained knowledge are immediate and obvious. This tight feedback loop is similarly rewarding when solving puzzles as the unfulfilled elements flash red and you're immediately given a chance to try again.

![](https://i.imgur.com/MYIFqeQ.jpg)

That being said, the game isn't perfect. For me, the biggest letdown was the lack of narrative payoff. Throughout the game the locations and mysterious statuses paint a story that begs to be explained, but nothing is offered. Also, while most of the puzzles are situated deliberately, there are a few puzzle rooms that are just panels on a wall without any deeper theme.

For your time and money, *The Witness* does a lot of things right. I'm glad I got it and look forward to circling back around to completed the areas I skipped before too long.

Honorable mention: **Ratchet & Clank: Into the Nexus**

As a longtime fan of the Ratchet & Clank series, I was excited to play the last installment released for PS3. Nervous it could surpass the complete experience that was *Crack in Time*, I was hesitant at first. I shouldn't have been worried; Insomniac Games once again proved that they can do a lot with a little. Despite its fairly short campaign, there's a lot of rewarding exploration do be done to do and I found coming back to *Nexus* long after I needed to.

### Mobile
Truth be told I don't play a lot of mobile games- none on my phone and a few on my iPad. Mostly puzzle games, or action ones with a puzzle component.


Winner: **Blackbox**

Runner-up: **Does Not Commute**

## Movies

It wasn't until I started looking back to the movies that came out throughout the year that

Winner(s): **Arrival**, **Captain America: Civil War**

Two winners? Yeah whatever, this is my list and these were both awesome movies.

![](https://i.imgur.com/CjHIgKA.jpg)

*Captain America: Civil War* was basically everything I might want from a [MCU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe) movie. I might be biased a huge fan of comic book movies, but that doesn't stop me from seeing this for what it is: probably the best superhero movie to date. [^4] An ensemble cast that was a good mix of funny and serious, quality fight scenes in interesting locations, and character development through a lot of dialog give the audience the feeling of a complete movie. They also paced it surprisingly well for as long as it is, which is tough to do in a (nearly) 3 hour movie.

![](https://i.imgur.com/yirFmL3.jpg)

*Arrival* was a breath of fresh air in what can be a stale genre. I'm a sucker for badass lady-scientists (see also: [Contact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_(1997_American_film))), so this was an easy sell. There was a big focus on linguistics and how words affect our perception. In a modern day where words and speech have become increasingly meaningful and scrutinized, this was especially engaging. Plus, it had a good setup and a satisfying payoff, something I prioritize.

Runner-up: **Deadpool**

I almost didn't see this. I was nervous about the character, because I was nearly certain that however he was portrayed he would be annoying and overbearing. I was never more happy to be wrong. In a (arguably over-saturated) field of superhero movies, *Deadpool* was self aware and managed to balance an emotional story against some absolutely hysterical moments. Its underdog success makes me a little concerned about a sequel and more studio interference, but who says lightning can't strike twice?

---

Honorable mention(s)[^5]:  *Storks* and *Zootopia*, for proving that there's space for a serious (and often meaningful) story while providing jokes that cater to all ages. Lastly *Rogue One*, for a pleasant surprise.

Dishonorable mention: Kung-Fu Panda 3, for completing the series' decline from the pinnacle of cinema to a fairly generic children's movie. The per-character in-fight catchphrases were a letdown.

## Books

I had a pretty good [reading list](https://airtable.com/shr4iBau1Ewwu5kxB) this year. It was also the year of the audiobook thanks to a few road trips I took. Working from home, I don't have a lot of time to listen to them but they really helped transform long drives.

Winner: **Gone Girl**, by Gillian Flynn

Runner-up: **The Mirage**, by Matt Ruff

And there you have it! 2016 wasn't all bad for media. Let's see where 2017 takes us.

[^1]: Or the worst time, as far as my wallet is concerned. Maybe I should try cocaine instead, save a few bucks

[^2]: This is especially rare because of the prevalence of sales for PC games. I'm a very [patient gamer](https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers) and am reticent to buy games at full price

[^3]: Talking to other engineering friends who have played this game, everyone had a remarkably identical experience. At the end of the week they either beat the game or were forcibly cut off by their SO

[^4]: At the top, it faces stiff competition from *The Avengers*, *The Dark Knight*, *Iron Man*, and *Deadpool*, but at this point I'm pretty sure it takes the cake.

[^5]: Sue me, there were a lot of good movies this year

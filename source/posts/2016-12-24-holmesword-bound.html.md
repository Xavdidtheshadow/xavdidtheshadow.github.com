*If you're just interested in the episode list, you can jump to it [here](#list)*.

Every year on Christmas Eve, my family found ourselves without any plans. Being Jewish, we had no particular family events to attend so we usually spent the day on or around the couch. My dad's proclivity for black & white films and/or murder mysteries lead to the yearly exploration of the many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.

There have been a few versions released recently, mostly notably Guy Ritchie's *Sherlock Holmes*, BBC's *Sherlock*, and CBS's *Elementary*. Each have their merits and "the best" has been [widely](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10535503/Sherlock-the-20-greatest-Sherlock-Holmes.html) [discussed](https://nypost.com/2014/01/16/elementary-vs-sherlock-whos-the-better-holmes/), but I wanted to take some time this holiday season to shed some light on what may be my favorite adaptation: __season one of *Elementary*__.

Adapting Holmes is a tricky thing- he's a well known character and most people have preconceived notions about how he and his compatriots should act and dress. Elementary helps differentiate itself via the bold statement of [gender bending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_bender) some of the main characters. Most notably, Lucy Liu's Dr *Joan* Watson provides a breath of fresh air to the time-hallowed duo. Mrs. Hudson's guest appearance finds her to be a drag queen, furthering its goal of a new experience.

Elementary doesn't shy from the idea that Sherlock is an [addict](http://wellingtongoose.tumblr.com/post/47045679219/sherlock-his-drug-habit-and-the-science-of), making it a core character trait instead of hinting at it like the BBC version does. Watson is initially hired as Sherlock's sober companion and their (wonderfully non-sexual) relationship grows throughout the run of the show. This and other choices (such as kink as a recurring theme) help season one feel unique among both other adaptations  and the rest of the show itself. If we're being honest, later seasons saw the show's quality lose the consistency of the first season, but that shouldn't detract from the way you enjoy the strength of Elementary's freshman outing.

Adherence to the industry standard of a 24-episode season means that there are some episodes in the season that are largely skippable. If your [TV queue](https://publists.herokuapp.com/user/6452502/lists/144762938) is as packed as mine, I've taken the liberty of picking the 13 episodes you need to watch to get the core experience. Watching these will give you the slim, focused experience of one of the greatest storytelling efforts I've seen on network TV.

Lucky for you, Elementary is widely available for purchase online, including on [Amazon](https://smile.amazon.com/Elementary-Season-1/dp/B009IJJB8G?sa-no-redirect=1), [iTunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/elementary-season-1/id550570883), and [Hulu](http://www.hulu.com/elementary). Without further ado, the <span id="list">list</span>:

* Episode 01: **Pilot**
* Episode 03: **Child Predator**
* Episode 06: **Flight Risk**
* Episode 12: **M**
* Episode 13: **The Red Team**
* Episode 14: **The Deductionist**
* Episode 15: **A Giant Gun, Filled with Drugs**
* Episode 17: **Possibility Two**
* Episode 19: **Snow Angels**
* Episode 21: **A Landmark Story**
* Episode 22: **Risk Management**
* Episode 23: **The Woman**
* Episode 24: **Heroine**

Each episode was selected for a combination of its writing, relevance to the season's arc, and overall originality. Rather than go through synopses of each episodes, I'll let them speak for themselves. These 13 hours solidify Elementary's case as one of the finest Holmes adaptations and are well worth your time. Regardless of what you watch this holiday season, I hope it brings you joy!

        I'm a huge proponent of startups. They're fun, I was able jump beteween productivity in all aspects of the company (back-end, front-end, UX, and growth hacking), and the food/beer/adventures tend to be top notch. During my time in college I had the opporunity to work at two,

        This site's favicon may look it was drawn by a 5 year old, but it was actually drawn by me. I'm not at all artistic (sister got all of the art genes), but I wanted to do this site myself, which meant favicon too. I'm super proud of it.

        I'm a maintainer for the
        %a{href: "https://github.com/adelevie/parse-ruby-client", target: "_blank"}<
          Parse Ruby Client
        and am in the process of guiding it into v1.0.

      -#   I'm a huge proponent of startups. They're fun, I was able jump between productivity in all aspects of the company (back-end, front-end, UX, and growth hacking), and the food/beer/adventures tend to be top notch. During my time in college I had the opportunity to work at two,
      -#   %a{href: "http://www.fetchnotes.com", target:"_blank"}<
      -#     Fetchnotes
      -#   and
      -#   %a{href: "http://backstit.ch", target:"_blank"}<
      -#     backstitch,
      -#   both of which gave me invaluable experience and excellent memories. The connections I made with these two teams are awesome and I will continue to keep in touch with them in the future

        I once found a

          bug
        in Chrome that got fixed.

        I whipped up a piece of
        %a{href: "https://gist.github.com/xavdid/8930419", target: "_blank"}<
          middleware
        so I could parse PayPal emails into IFTTT. I also wrote a

          blog post
        about the process.

        This site's favicon may look it was drawn by a 5 year old, but it was me. I'm not particularly artistic, but I wanted to build this site myself (which meant favicon too). I'm super proud of the way it turned out. Otherwise, the site was designed mostly by

        with some helpfully rejected suggestions from myself.

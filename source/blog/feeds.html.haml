      In case you'd like to be notified every time I post something I write, this site provides the following feed formats:

    %ul
      %li
        = link_to('XML', '/blog/feed.xml')
        \- great for RSS readers or
        = link_to('Zapier', "https://zapier.com/apps/rss/integrations")
      %li
        = link_to('JSON', '/blog/feed.json')
        \- for those still hoping for good JSON feed apps
    %p
      Thanks a bunch!

      Hey, how's it going?
    %p
      My name's David. I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Computing Informatics not that long ago. I'm a software developer by trade and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently they let anyone put websites online these days, so welcome to mine.

      Things I'm fond of
    %p
      I like interpreted languages, computer automation, CSS, Mac OS X, productivity apps, afternoon naps, and dark work environments. I travel as much as I can and love visiting friends around the world.

    There should be a random fact here. What do you have against javascript?
    
  :javascript
    var i = getRandomInt(0,facts.length-1);
    $(".fact").html(facts[i]);
    document.getElementById("ichi").className+=" active";

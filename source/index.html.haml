      Hey, how's it going?
    %p
      My name's David. I'm a jack of all trades about to graduate from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Arts in Social Computing Informatics. I'm a software developer, web-cool-guy, and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently, they let anyone put websites online these days. This site is and shall be my sandbox for all things that I may want to put on the internet.

      Things I'm fond of
    %p
      I like CSS, interpreted languages, computer automation, Mac OS X, productivity apps, and dark work enviroments. I travel as much as I can and love visiting friends in their respective cities around the world.

      My life right now
    %p
      I'm currently searching for a job that I can start after I graduate. Ideally, this would be doing software development at a medium size company where I get to live in a cool city and work with cool people. I've been playing the game that whenever I'm on a site with a job listing, I apply. I'm all about that "wide net" approach.

    There should be a random fact here. What do you have against javascript?
    
  :javascript
    var i = getRandomInt(0,facts.length-1);
    $(".fact").html(facts[i]);
    document.getElementById("ichi").className="active";

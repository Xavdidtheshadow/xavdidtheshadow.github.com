go to [here](#here)
go to [better](#the-best)

# This is a title

## this is h2

### this is h3

#### this is h4

##### this is h5

###### this is h6

highlighted code block[^1]:

```js
const a = 3;
const o = {};
o.a = a;
```

## the best

and now some ~~ruby~~ `python`

```py
a = 3
d = {}
d['asdf'] = a
for i in range(3):
    print(i)
```

<a name="here" />

now, a quote:

> I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.

and so we have it

|                          | `(D)` & Union | `(R)` & Union | `(D)` & Confederacy | `(R)` & Confederacy |
| ------------------------ | ------------- | ------------- | ------------------- | ------------------- |
| Senate                   | 98%           | 84%           | 5%                  | 0%                  |
| House of Representatives | 95%           | 85%           | 9%                  | 0%                  |

    is this code?
    or is this dancer?

anyway

[^1]: did we do it?

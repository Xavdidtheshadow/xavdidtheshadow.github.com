Hello! I'm David, and I'm excited to work with you. This is a short document meant to help you up to speed with how I work as an Individual Contributor. This document isn't meant to an exhaustive list, but a crash course in David 101.

What follows is written with inspiration from [Amy Nguyen's _"Working with me"_](https://amy.dev/?p=979) and other READMEs I've read internally while at Zapier.

## About Me

- I've been working at tech companies since I graduated from the University of Michigan in 2014.
- I make friends quickly and rarely hold grudges.
- I go by David, never Dave, Davy, etc. "Brownman" is ok if we're like, on a sports team.
- I'm not on many sports teams.

## How I Work

- I'm incredibly forgetful, but I'm good at setting myself reminders in Slack and [Things 3](https://culturedcode.com/things/), my todo [app of choice](/blog/post/my-perfect-task-app/).
- I do my most effective project work when I have a long backlog of tasks I can work through at my own pace.
- If I don't have something assigned, I'll find something to do.
  - This will likely be a minor bug that I've been meaning to fix; it will typically not be something that appears on a company roadmap.
  - My doing this _could_ be considered a "feature"; I can fix a lot of things this way.
  - If you rather I not do this, help me make sure I always have a "next thing" to work on.
- Because I spend so much time helping others in Slack (see [Strengths](#strengths)), I try to avoid taking on too many concurrent projects. I don't want to feel like I don't have enough time budget to read Slack.
- I prize receiving feedback. If I've wronged you or done something badly, _please_ let me know.

### Slack

- I'm a Slack completionist: I read 100% of all channels I'm in (from when I decide to join the channel, I don't back-fill).
- Don't worry about me missing a message; if it's in a channel I'm in, I'll see it.
- Slack is almost always open on my computer and I check it frequently during my work hours.
- You can `@ mention` me somewhere and I'll see it right away. If it's not urgent, I'd prefer you didn't ping me; I'll see it eventually.
- I always keep my Slack status up to date. Reading it will help you know when I'll reply to your message. It's usually one of:
  - at my computer
  - back soon (errand/lunch/etc)
  - gone for the day/weekend
  - OOO (will have return date)
  - something else, will be descriptive
- I _don't_ have work slack on my phone. If I'm not at my computer and "in the office", I won't see your message until I'm back.
- I _do_ have work email on my phone. I don't get push notifications, but check it periodically. That's a good way to reach me if something is urgent and I won't be back at Slack for a while.

### Hours

- I usually work in US Pacific time.
- Try as I might, I'm just not a morning person.
- I usually wake up at 9:30am and am online around 10. I'll lunch around 1pm.
- My best focus time is pre-lunch or late at night.
- My energy flags around 4pm and I'll try to take an exercise / sun break.
  - If I do, I'll wrap up my work for the day either pre-dinner or later that evening (~10pm).
  - If I skip the workout, then I'll push through and go offline by 6pm.
  - You can feel free to remind me that I like working out, if I seem to be skipping it a lot. I am always happier after a lift, but sometimes I forget that.
- During the pandemic, I stopped setting a morning alarm. It was nice to always get as much sleep as I wanted. As a result, my start time would fluctuate. Not sure yet if I'll keep that up.

### Meetings

- If I know I have a meeting later, I usually get less work done until then ("well, I can't get into anything; I've got a meeting soon").
- I try to schedule all my meetings in a single block (aka the [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/) method), no gaps needed.
- I try to put all my meetings on a single day (or two). At Zapier, I try to only take meetings on Wed & Thurs.
- I'm happy to take meetings any time during my working hours, but prefer the afternoon (see [hours](#hours)).
- I can take meetings up to 1 hour before my normal start time (typically 9am) if it's an important meeting. I have trouble getting up earlier than that and my energy level will be shot the rest of the day.
- I'm happy to take late-evening meetings for time-zone reasons (greatly preferred to early morning ones).
- I'm also happy to sit and synchronously Slack with you about a topic - that can sometimes be preferred if we're trading a lot of links
- I am usually happy to have a call with you about basically any subject, but please try to schedule it in a way that's not disruptive to the rest of my schedule.

## What Drives Me

### Helping

My biggest motivation comes from knowing I have helped someone.

In a product org, this typically means talking with the beneficiaries of whatever it is I help make. That could be our company's end-users, internal stakeholders, or strangers who rely on my open source packages. This isn't a strict requirement for my job, but I'm most gratified (and as a result, motivated) when I know how others have benefited from my work. At Zapier, I make a point to hear from our [developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vhh_GeBPOhs) via help tickets, [community](https://community.zapier.com/developer-discussion-13), and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1825390/xavdid).

For managers, pointing me towards examples where I've had direct, beneficial impact on coworkers can help energize me out of a slump. For coworkers, an occasional DM letting me know that I helped you never fails to make my day.

### Learning

I am the very definition of a "lifelong learner". I love to learn about the world just for the sake of it. Sometimes, this is even useful for work purposes! I try to record useful info into [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), the app that most closely mirrors how my brain works. I'm usually interested in tasks where I can do something I've never done before.

### Teaching

I am energized by teaching; I get a lot of gratification from helping someone understand something new.

Sometimes, this is direct action (like answering [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1825390/xavdid) questions, pairing, or mentoring; see below). Other times, it's educational documents/guides that I throw into the ether, like my [Advent of Code tutorials](https://github.com/xavdid/advent-of-code/tree/main/solutions/2020/day_1) (which I'm very proud of). Answering questions in Slack is basically tiny teaching, so that's why I enjoy it so much.

### Exploring Technical Interests

I don't usually work on projects relating to the topics in this list. When I do, it's a fun bonus! In no particular order:

- Dynamically generating/transforming code
- Type systems
- Creating CLI tools
- Learning a new technology or programming language
- Alternative computer input methods (such as unusual controllers or keyboards)
  - I use an [Ergodox-EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com/) as my main keyboard. I like how customizable it is. You can see my full layout [here](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/LMnJ6/latest/0).
  - I've got a [Steam controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Controller) for similar reasons
- Organizing and cataloguing data (especially with [Airtable](https://airtable.com/))

## Strengths

- I know a little bit about a lot of topics.
- Because of [how I use Slack](#slack), I have a lot of context of the state of the company.
- A lot of my daily energy goes towards making the people and teams around me more effective.
- I'm good at writing code interfaces and understanding how consumers will want to use our code.
- I enjoy documenting code and processes.
- I'm good at breaking down problems.
- Pub trivia. Mostly because of the aforementioned breadth of knowledge.

## Weaknesses

- I tend to program "by feel". If a test reports an off-by-one error, I'll tweak a line and re-run the tests. If that works, great! If it doesn't... I'll try, try again. If that doesn't clear it up, I'll actually read the code and make the correct fix.
- I'm quick to suggest re-writing existing code, especially if I don't understand it well or think I can modernize it. As my manager/PM, you'll probably need to talk me down from this at least once.
- Because I spend so much time on Slack helping others, my raw code output is usually less than that of my peers. This is usually a net win for the team, but is something to take into consideration if we need a lot of code written quickly.
- I sometimes get compulsively distracted by Reddit/Twitter/Slack and need to take a computer break.
- I'm optimistic - this serves me well in life, but poorly when estimating how long projects will take.
- I'm a horrible speller. These days, computers usually cover for me, but they can only get you so far.

## Outside of Work

- You can find me on most sites as `@xavdid`.
- I'm mostly a homebody, although I have traveled a lot. I road-tripped cross-country in a van for six months with my then-fianc√©e; ask me about #vanlife!
- At home, my major hobbies are:
  - video games (favorite genres: puzzle, adventure, narrative, co-op)
  - tinkering/programming (either on something novel or something useful, but rarely both)
  - board games, especially with friends
  - [blogging](/blog), occasionally

Anyway, enough about me. What's next?

# Welcome to my Home on the World Wide Web

I'm a software developer by trade and I've created this site as a one-stop shop for information pertaining to my personal and professional lives. Apparently they let anyone put websites online these days, so welcome to mine.

## Things I'm fond of

I like interpreted languages, computer automation, CSS, productivity apps, afternoon naps, build tools, and dark work environments. I travel as much as I can and love visiting friends around the world (though that's on a temporary pandemic hiatus).

## My life right now

I'm a Senior Platform Engineer at [Zapier](https://zapier.com) and am currently working remotely around the US. I live in [a van](https://instagram.com/serenitythevan) with my fianc√©e (by choice; also on a temporary pandemic hiatus).

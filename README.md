You're looking at the source for my personal website! It's a bunch of markdown and haml that are turned into static html using [middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/). 

There's a gemfile and a build script, so you should be able to clone, `bundle install`, and `./build.sh` to see a complete version of the site locally.

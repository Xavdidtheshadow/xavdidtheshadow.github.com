<p>I feel good about the fact that, for the most part, I live my life free of any vices. That is, except for one:</p>

<p><strong>Adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit, I&#39;ve been addict for a while now. Starting in 8th grade, I met a set of friends who loved to explore and experience the wonderful space that is Boulder, CO. My summer was spent surfing from couch to couch (when I got around to sleeping) not being home for days at a time despite being less than a mile from home. Despite being a homebody, summer is a time to be OUT.</p>

<p></p>

<p>The most consistent way to get your fix is by traveling, especially to somewhere you&#39;ve never been (or don&#39;t go often). So, I&#39;ll often go out of my way to go somewhere new. Luckily, this can be done on a budget in the form of <a href="http://xkcd.com/426/">Geohashing</a>. During the latter part of high school in Houston, most weekends found my partner in crime (the lovely Jenny) and I traipsing off into some rural TX county in search of a point in space. There wouldn&#39;t be anything there, nor would we necessarily be able to even reach it (without a boat or helicopter), but that didn&#39;t matter. As is repeated all too often- it&#39;s not the destination that matters, it&#39;s the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypNgvc6c6Cc">journey</a>.</p>

<p>Speaking of trips, let me tell you about one of my favorites. During spring break my sophomore year of college, I went to visit friends in the Pacific northwest. But, I first had an a cappella competition in DC, so I needed to get creative with my transportation.</p>

<p>Flew from Detroit to Baltimore to ride in a van into DC on Friday afternoon. Sunday morning I flew out of Dulles, through LaGuardia, and straight through to Portland. Hung out there a few days (visiting the wonderful Andrew and Tyler), then I hopped on the Amtrak train up to Bellingham, WA (for special pizza time with Quinlan), and then a bus down to Seattle (where I had the chance to explore with Nearl for the weekend). From there, I flew straight home to DTW rounding out the adventure.</p>

<p>The best thing about that trip (besides seeing all of my friends) was that I purposely tried to get to as many new airports and cities as I could. In each new place, I made sure to take as much public transport as I could, as I feel like that&#39;s the best way to get to know a city. Be it train, bus, rail, or moving sidewalk, I&#39;m on it. It&#39;s where you meet the people, the true lifeblood of your current locale.</p>

<p>Why does this matter to you, dear reader? Especially because I&#39;m now working full time, I&#39;ve realized it&#39;s not always that easy to adventure as much as you&#39;d like. The beautiful thing about adventures though, is that size really doesn&#39;t matter. Your adventure doesn&#39;t need to be a grandiose trip around the world to be considered adventurous. Just something as small as leaving your comfort zone, your little bubble of humanity that&#39;s yours and yours alone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all well and good that you&#39;ve carved out your niche where you&#39;re happy (and everyone knows your name), but life isn&#39;t lived in a bubble. Take it from me and get out there. Scare yourself a little, and take that first step.</p>

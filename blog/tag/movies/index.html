</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>Once I started tracking media in earnest, I found myself in need of a consistent way to rate what I had watched and played. There's a lot of different ways to rate something, such a 10 star scale, a score out out of five, or a simple thumbs up/down.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe is that none of the scores <em>really</em> mean anything; they're good for comparing everything someone has scored, but they each have their problems. A 10 star scale is too wide; what sets a 6 star movie apart from a 7 star? The yes/no is informative but has the opposite problem: it doesn't allow for any striation between good and great. A score out of 5 is closer, but it begets my worst enemy: <em>apathy</em>. I'm ultimately making these lists to help steer the reader towards the good stuff. If I'm neutral on something, it doesn't provide a definitive signal. Ultimately, none of these scales provided what I needed.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>We're fast reaching the climax of the most ambitious film projects ever conceived: 18 movies over the course of 10 years, ranging from "really good" to "I wish they hadn't made this, but here we are". To properly prepare myself for <em>Infinity War</em>, I went back and watched the entire canon of MCU movies. It was the perfect opportunity to compile my personal power ranking for all 18 films, which I'm pleased to present to you now.</p>

<p>While building this list, I watched each movie in order. Movies were judged loosely on categories such as humor, action, cohesiveness, and writing. Then I decided where it fit in based on those I had watched already.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> All movies I watch fall into one of four categories: Awful, Bad, Good, and Great, which is also how I bracketed these. You probably won't agree with everything, but this is my list. If you need a refresher of what all the movies are, check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe#Feature_films">Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>Without further ado, from worst to best, here's every Marvel Cinematic Universe film (so far).</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>In my advanced age, I've found myself with the time and inclination to consume a lot of media. As part of that, I feel like I have am obligation to share the best things I experienced in the past year with you, the loyal reader. I wrote a similar article <a href="/blog/2017/02/11/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/">last year</a>, but in case this is your first time (welcome!), I'll run through the rules for how media qualifies for the coveted "Davy" award:</p>

<ul>
<li>media qualifies for the list for the calendar year during which I finish it for the first time</li>
<li>winners are picked based on what I enjoyed most, not what is objectively "the best". You probably wouldn't rank stuff the same way, but that's okay. This is my list, not yours</li>
<li>if something is critically acclaimed and I'm just getting around to watching it, it probably won't win. Sorry, <em>The West Wing</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>With that under our belts, let's dive in!</p>

<p><em>Spoiler note: Everything up until the Big Bold Warning is strictly spoiler free!</em></p>

<p>Spanning multiple reboots, timelines, and source material, Fox's X-Men franchise can be a lot to get a handle on. In preparation for seeing Logan, I wanted to go back through and watch all of the X-Men movies. There's a hitch though- there's no defined order to watch them in. Star Wars has <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">Machete Order</a>, but with the X-Men's contradicting timelines, it's hard to know the best way to experience them as a first time (or repeat) viewer.</p>

<p>As a series, the X-Men movies tell the saga of Wolverine. As the only character (and actor) in every movie, he is the thread that binds them all. Following his journey gives us a fairly straightforward look into how it actually happens.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: This was originally written to go out on Dec 31 but it was delayed. Nevertheless, it's written as if it was posted then.</em></p>

<p>As 2016 draws to a close, it's a convenient time to look back on the last 12 months to some of the media I've enjoyed the most this past year. It might have been a tire fire as far as politics and celebrity deaths go, but there are a lot of metrics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei8M9IuqPc">trending</a> in the right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThmAZ9yXqE">direction</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I started getting into tracking what I read, watched, and played in earnest this year. In an effort to share the fruits of that labor, I thought I'd make a year-end list of some of my favorites. This endeavor is inspired in no small part by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-web-services-2016-edition/">Viticci's list</a> of a similar nature. Though my picks weren't necessarily released in 2016, this calendar year is the first time I experienced (or finished) them. It's highly subjective, but hopefully there's interests we have that overlap.</p>

<p>Let's get to it!</p>

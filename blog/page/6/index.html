</h1>

<p>There he stood, in the rain, on his last night in town. Gazing over the city, laid before him like lights on a tree, he fondly remembered the times he spent in residence there. Permanent, it had seemed, but all too fleeting in practice. Experiences of adventure, danger, and love alike flooded his mind, all too soon to be left behind in that small mountain city. But the only way to conquer is to move on, thus he got in the car and drove off.</p>

<p>He was troubled as he drove west. That last mission went well, but it seemed all too easy. Between the bevy of midnight car chases and the smattering of (PG Rated, of course) sex scenes, it seemed to clear itself up a little too cleanly. "No matter" he thought to himself. "Best thing to do now is just to keep on with the mission and avoid anything unpla..." And then the phone rang.</p>

<p>I feel good about the fact that, for the most part, I live my life free of any vices. That is, except for one:</p>

<p><strong>Adventure.</strong></p>

<p>I'll admit, I've been addict for a while now. Starting in 8th grade, I met a set of friends who loved to explore and experience the wonderful space that is Boulder, CO. My summer was spent surfing from couch to couch (when I got around to sleeping) not being home for days at a time despite being less than a mile from home. Despite being a homebody, summer is a time to be OUT.</p>

<p>We as humans thrive through being social.</p>

<p>As a culture, we've known this for ages, and we structure our upbringing to accommodate that. That first day of preschool we play name games and are pushed to get to know anyone we haven't met before so we can grow accustomed to interacting with other humans. This continues throughout our primary education (in earnest) and onward.</p>

<p>Though this is nothing new, the advent of Facebook has revolutionized the way it affects our daily life. Where before we just had a mental list of people we knew, we now have a solid (and permissively public) catalog to browse and utilize. This simple register opens up so many awesome possibilities. Suddenly, we've got a framework to support apps like <a href="https://www.onlulu.com/">Lulu</a>, <a href="http://www.stik.com/">Stik</a>, and more.</p>

<p>Good and evil, black and white, light and shadow: the classic dichotomy of our society.</p>

<p>We're so obsessed with characterizing ourselves as either one or the other. So much so, in fact, that we disregard people who aren't of our alignment. A virtuous person doesn't make a habit of fraternizing with criminals, and vice versa (assuming for ease of argument that everyone fits into D&amp;D's <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZSr3ATi.jpg">9 personality alignments</a>).</p>

<p>We preoccupy ourselves with what other people think of us. We capitalize on social outlets so that everyone else can know how virtuous we are. If we do bad things, we (usually) don't broadcast it. We operate under the assumption that if we're more staunchly nice or mean, we'll get more rewards appropriate with such a station (be they wealth, power, respect, whatever floats your boat).</p>

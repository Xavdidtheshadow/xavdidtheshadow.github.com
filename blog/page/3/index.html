<p>It's a large genus of snake found mostly in Africa and the sub-continent of Asia. Wait, that's not important right now.</p>

<p>Really though, Python a programming language. It's good for lots of simple tasks and I think everyone should know a bit about it. It also has the added bonus of being popular for data manipulation. It doesn't matter what field you're in, there's going to be some task that can be improved or eased by a computer doing more of the lifting for you. This guide is aimed at people with no technological experience and should be easy to pick up and help you be computer-awesome in no time.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em>Learning to code is a lot like riding a bike: you're still a fine person if you can't, but learning to do so will save you a lot of time.</em></p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>Anyone who's played a game with children knows that rules, much like a pirate's code, are mostly "guidelines". However, these games (even when played between children) are not without structure. Instead, children tend to follow unspoken adaptions of rule sets that allow for flexibility and argument. (Hughes p. 509) In a world where all social cues and pretext are dropped (where, like children, we can only judge people from their actions (both vocal and physical)), the rules of conversation and social decorum are totally different, as seen in <a href="http://www.habbo.com">Habbo Hotel</a>. Nevertheless, there's a new set of codes that dictate how interactions should happen and they have some fascinating parallels to real social interaction.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>People play many sorts of games for many sorts of reasons, but they all share one very important quality: games are pretending to be something else. It doesn't matter if you play <em>Call of Duty</em> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_Game"><em>The Bible Game</em></a>, the point of the software is to manipulate people or events that aren't real. (p. 427) There are a lot of design choices associated with the creation of games, particularly those that simulate something else explicitly.</p>

<p>You know a lot of people, probably. Some of them game, some don't, and each has their own reasons for doing so. In Sutton-Smith's chapter <em>Rhetoric of Self</em>, he talks about how sometimes "it's not the player that plays the game, but the game which plays the player" (p 181). Thatgamecompany's <a href="http://www.jenovachen.com/flowingames/flowing.htm"><em>Flow</em></a> demonstrates this by placing the player into a game without instruction or direction and let's the experienceâ€¦ flow off them, if you will.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p><em>This is a piece I wrote for the city of Houston's Public Service Recognition Week in 2010. It ended up winning me first prize and a nice ceremony in the library, which was neat.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>"Oh, just grab a bottle of water, honey. We can carry it in our pocket, drink it, and then just toss it out somewhere along the way." This conversation is heard in my house all too often. In America, the most wasteful country in the world, Houston regularly finds itself at the bottom of the recycling list. However, all is not lost: if I were a Recycling Manager, I would make recycling easy and fun, sending the city on its way to a greener life.</p>

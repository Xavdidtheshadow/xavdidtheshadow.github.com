<p><em>Spoiler note: Everything up until the Big Bold Warning is strictly spoiler free!</em></p>

<p>Spanning multiple reboots, timelines, and source material, Fox's X-Men franchise can be a lot to get a handle on. In preparation for seeing Logan, I wanted to go back through and watch all of the X-Men movies. There's a hitch though- there's no defined order to watch them in. Star Wars has <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">Machete Order</a>, but with the X-Men's contradicting timelines, it's hard to know the best way to experience them as a first time (or repeat) viewer.</p>

<p>As a series, the X-Men movies tell the saga of Wolverine. As the only character (and actor) in every movie, he is the thread that binds them all. Following his journey gives us a fairly straightforward look into how it actually happens.</p>

<p><em>Editors Note: This was originally written to go out on Dec 31 but it was delayed. Nevertheless, it's written as if it was posted then.</em></p>

<p>As 2016 draws to a close, it's a convenient time to look back on the last 12 months to some of the media I've enjoyed the most this past year. It might have been a tire fire as far as politics and celebrity deaths go, but there are a lot of metrics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei8M9IuqPc">trending</a> in the right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThmAZ9yXqE">direction</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I started getting into tracking what I read, watched, and played in earnest this year. In an effort to share the fruits of that labor, I thought I'd make a year-end list of some of my favorites. This endeavor is inspired in no small part by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-web-services-2016-edition/">Viticci's list</a> of a similar nature. Though my picks weren't necessarily released in 2016, this calendar year is the first time I experienced (or finished) them. It's highly subjective, but hopefully there's interests we have that overlap.</p>

<p>Let's get to it!</p>

<p><em>If you're just interested in the episode list, you can jump to it <a href="#list">here</a></em>.</p>

<p>Every year on Christmas Eve, my family found ourselves without any plans. Being Jewish, we had no particular family events to attend so we usually spent the day on or around the couch. My dad's proclivity for black &amp; white films and/or murder mysteries lead to the yearly exploration of the many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>There have been a few versions released recently, mostly notably Guy Ritchie's <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, BBC's <em>Sherlock</em>, and CBS's <em>Elementary</em>. Each have their merits and "the best" has been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10535503/Sherlock-the-20-greatest-Sherlock-Holmes.html">widely</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/01/16/elementary-vs-sherlock-whos-the-better-holmes/">discussed</a>, but I wanted to take some time this holiday season to shed some light on what may be my favorite adaptation: <strong>season one of <em>Elementary</em></strong>.</p>

<p>Now that the dust has settled from World Cup, my Anonymous Associate and I thought it would be worthwhile to look through the numbers on game length and scoring data from throughout the season and see how impactful the snitch was.</p>

<p>Our initial <a href="https://youtu.be/zNdkrtfZP8I?t=4m13s">feeling</a> was that the snitch was too impactful relative total quaffle points scored. We recently scraped a complete set of games played last season, so we thought we'd put our idea the test.</p>

<p><em>Editors Note: This was originally written to go out on Dec 31 but it was delayed. Nevertheless, it's written as if it was posted then.</em></p>

<p>As 2016 draws to a close, it's a convenient time to look back on the last 12 months to some of the media I've enjoyed the most this past year. It might have been a tire fire as far as politics and celebrity deaths go, but there are a lot of metrics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei8M9IuqPc">trending</a> in the right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThmAZ9yXqE">direction</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I started getting into tracking what I read, watched, and played in earnest this year. In an effort to share the fruits of that labor, I thought I'd make a year-end list of some of my favorites. This endeavor is inspired in no small part by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-web-services-2016-edition/">Viticci's list</a> of a similar nature. Though my picks weren't necessarily released in 2016, this calendar year is the first time I experienced (or finished) them. It's highly subjective, but hopefully there's interests we have that overlap.</p>

<p>Let's get to it!</p>

<p>Every year on Christmas Eve, my family found ourselves without any plans. Being Jewish, we had no particular family events to attend so we usually spent the day on or around the couch. My dad's proclivity for black &amp; white films and/or murder mysteries lead to the yearly exploration of the many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes.</p>

<p>There have been a few versions released recently, mostly notably Guy Ritchie's <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>, BBC's <em>Sherlock</em>, and CBS's <em>Elementary</em>. Each have their merits and "the best" has been <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10535503/Sherlock-the-20-greatest-Sherlock-Holmes.html">widely</a> <a href="https://nypost.com/2014/01/16/elementary-vs-sherlock-whos-the-better-holmes/">discussed</a>, but I wanted to take some time this holiday season to shed some light on what may be my favorite adaptation: <strong>season one of <em>Elementary</em></strong>.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>Now that the dust has settled from World Cup, my Anonymous Associate and I thought it would be worthwhile to look through the numbers on game length and scoring data from throughout the season and see how impactful the snitch was.</p>

<p>Our initial <a href="https://youtu.be/zNdkrtfZP8I?t=4m13s">feeling</a> was that the snitch was too impactful relative total quaffle points scored. We recently scraped a complete set of games played last season, so we thought we'd put our idea the test.</p>

<p>As I'm back in the job market, I figured it was time to clean up some of my site internals. I've learned a lot about a lot since I first built it and my scss in particular was really showing its age. While I was in the trenches, I realized there was another big pain point I could fix: my blog.</p>

<p>For a long time, I had my blog in two places. It actually lived on tumblr, but I mirrored it on the blog section of my site using tumblr's APIv1. This was accomplished with some jQuery that would trigger on load and populate a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>This was <em>fine</em>, but it meant I was maintaining two sets of css and user experience was inconsistent depending on which platform they were reading on. I was already leveraging <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">middleman</a> to generate my static site and found that they have a <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging">blogging</a> extension. Moving all my posts would allow me to check my posts into git and use triple ` notation for code blocks. The only hiccup was that tumblr has no way to export all of your posts, so it was time to dive back into their API. The game was afoot.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>We as developers are working in a golden age of programming where pushing code has never been easier. My personal favorite place to deploy things is <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> because of its customizability, clear (and cheap) pricing structure, and powerful tools.</p>

<p>The most powerful place developers interact with the Heroku platform is on the command line. The recent release of a new version of their <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli">CLI</a> gave me a great excuse to rewrite an abandoned plugin that I relied on. Unfortunately, save a pair of very helpful doc pages, there were relatively few resources on some of the corner cases you hit while developing a plugin. Here, I'll aim to guide you through some of them.</p>

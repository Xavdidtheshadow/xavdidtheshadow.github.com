</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p><em>Editor's note: this list is a non-exhaustive list of my favorite media from the past year. There are things I like that aren't on the list (especially my girlfriend).</em></p>

<p>In my advanced age, I've found myself with the time and inclination to consume a lot of media. As part of that, I feel like I have am obligation to share the best things I experienced in the past year with you, the loyal reader. I wrote a similar article <a href="/blog/2017/02/11/a-few-of-my-favorite-things/">last year</a>, but in case this is your first time (welcome!), I'll run through the rules for how media qualifies for the coveted "Davy" award:</p>

<ul>
<li>media qualifies for the list for the calendar year during which I finish it for the first time</li>
<li>winners are picked based on what I enjoyed most, not what is objectively "the best". You probably wouldn't rank stuff the same way, but that's okay. This is my list, not yours</li>
<li>if something is critically acclaimed and I'm just getting around to watching it, it probably won't win. Sorry, <em>The West Wing</em>
</li>
</ul>

<p>With that under our belts, let's dive in!</p>

<p>For whatever reason, there's a lot of humor in programming. From bogus HTTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol">responses</a> to <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/">fun jargon</a>, we're a funny bunch. In practice, the only thing funnier than an idea is an idea that actually runs, so I decided to see how awful Bad Code could really be.</p>

<p>The searching and sorting of arrays is a popular (and central) topic in computer science. There's been a lot of time and effort spent ensuring we can sort array as efficiently as possible. Typically, efficiency in sorting methods is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation">measured</a> as a function of input length vs number of loops. A great sort won't appreciably increase ruznning time as the input gets longer. A bad sort, on the other hand...</p>

<p>When the topic of bad searches come up (at parties or whatever, as it does), a crowd favorite is always the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort">bogosort</a>. The idea is simple: take an array, randomize it, and check if it's sorted. If not, repeat! In the best case, you got really lucky and this sort is <em>very fast</em>. Most of the time, you're less lucky and this is actively awful. Let's see how this would shake out in practice.</p>

<p>Your data is in constant danger.</p>

<p>Your address, credit card number, and anything else you have available online is ripe for the taking should an attacker gain access to your accounts. If you use the internet at all (and you're reading this, I know you do), there are people out there that would happily sell access to your account to the highest bidder, forever compromising that password and any data associated with it.</p>

<p>When you think of a hacker, you might think about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/itsaunixsystem/top/?sort=top&amp;t=all">ridiculous scenes</a> from movies. A shadowy figure's fingers fly over a keyboard in a poorly lit room as green text cascades down their four monitors. The reality of the situation is much more banal; programs run over the course of hours, breaking protected versions of passwords into their plaintext form. Once that's done, a hacker has unfettered access to any accounts they unlocked directly, plus anything else that reused that password. While nothing can keep you <em>completely</em> safe from a dedicated hacker, you can make yourself as tough of a target as possible. To best understand this, let's take a journey through the steps of a typical hack, what makes it dangerous, and steps you can take to mitigate your risk.</p>

<p><em>Spoiler note: Everything up until the Big Bold Warning is strictly spoiler free!</em></p>

<p>Spanning multiple reboots, timelines, and source material, Fox's X-Men franchise can be a lot to get a handle on. In preparation for seeing Logan, I wanted to go back through and watch all of the X-Men movies. There's a hitch though- there's no defined order to watch them in. Star Wars has <a href="http://www.nomachetejuggling.com/2011/11/11/the-star-wars-saga-suggested-viewing-order/">Machete Order</a>, but with the X-Men's contradicting timelines, it's hard to know the best way to experience them as a first time (or repeat) viewer.</p>

<p>As a series, the X-Men movies tell the saga of Wolverine. As the only character (and actor) in every movie, he is the thread that binds them all. Following his journey gives us a fairly straightforward look into how it actually happens.</p>

<p><em>Editor's Note: This was originally written to go out on Dec 31 but it was delayed. Nevertheless, it's written as if it was posted then.</em></p>

<p>As 2016 draws to a close, it's a convenient time to look back on the last 12 months to some of the media I've enjoyed the most this past year. It might have been a tire fire as far as politics and celebrity deaths go, but there are a lot of metrics <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wei8M9IuqPc">trending</a> in the right <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aThmAZ9yXqE">direction</a>.</p>

<p>On a personal level, I started getting into tracking what I read, watched, and played in earnest this year. In an effort to share the fruits of that labor, I thought I'd make a year-end list of some of my favorites. This endeavor is inspired in no small part by <a href="https://www.macstories.net/roundups/my-must-have-ios-apps-web-services-2016-edition/">Viticci's list</a> of a similar nature. Though my picks weren't necessarily released in 2016, this calendar year is the first time I experienced (or finished) them. It's highly subjective, but hopefully there's interests we have that overlap.</p>

<p>Let's get to it!</p>

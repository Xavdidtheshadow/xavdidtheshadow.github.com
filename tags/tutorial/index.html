<p>As I'm back in the job market, I figured it was time to clean up some of my site internals. I've learned a lot about a lot since I first built it and my scss in particular was really showing its age. While I was in the trenches, I realized there was another big pain point I could fix: my blog.</p>

<p>For a long time, I had my blog in two places. It actually lived on tumblr, but I mirrored it on the blog section of my site using tumblr's APIv1. This was accomplished with some jQuery that would trigger on load and populate a <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</p>

<p>This was <em>fine</em>, but it meant I was maintaining two sets of css and user experience was inconsistent depending on which platform they were reading on. I was already leveraging <a href="https://middlemanapp.com">middleman</a> to generate my static site and found that they have a <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging">blogging</a> extension. Moving all my posts would allow me to check my posts into git and use triple ` notation for code blocks. The only hiccup was that tumblr has no way to export all of your posts, so it was time to dive back into their API. The game was afoot.</p>

</h1>
<div class='post-body'>
<p>We as developers are working in a golden age of programming where pushing code has never been easier. My personal favorite place to deploy things is <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> because of its customizability, clear (and cheap) pricing structure, and powerful tools.</p>

<p>The most powerful place developers interact with the Heroku platform is on the command line. The recent release of a new version of their <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli">CLI</a> gave me a great excuse to rewrite an abandoned plugin that I relied on. Unfortunately, save a pair of very helpful doc pages, there were relatively few resources on some of the corner cases you hit while developing a plugin. Here, I'll aim to guide you through some of them.</p>

<p>As you may or may not be aware, <a href="https://code.org/learn">Code.org</a> is a non-profit that aims to bring computer science education to people of all ages. They put out some great videos like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FC5FbmsH4fw">this</a> one illustrating how cool computer science is. Their message is one about the future and I think it's something really worth pursuing because at its core, it's a message about how you can change the world.</p>

</h1>

<p>It's a large genus of snake found mostly in Africa and the sub-continent of Asia. Wait, that's not important right now.</p>

<p>Really though, Python a programming language. It's good for lots of simple tasks and I think everyone should know a bit about it. It also has the added bonus of being popular for data manipulation. It doesn't matter what field you're in, there's going to be some task that can be improved or eased by a computer doing more of the lifting for you. This guide is aimed at people with no technological experience and should be easy to pick up and help you be computer-awesome in no time.</p>

<p><strong>Remember:</strong> <em>Learning to code is a lot like riding a bike: you're still a fine person if you can't, but learning to do so will save you a lot of time.</em></p>
